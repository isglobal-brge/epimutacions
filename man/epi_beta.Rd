between the CpG and the mean methylation to
consider a position an outlier.}

\value{
The function returns a data frame with
the candidate regions to be epimutations.

\description{
\code{epi_beta} method models the DNA methylation data
using a beta distribution.
First, the beta distribution parameters of the
reference population are precomputed and passed to the method.
Then, we compute the probability of observing the methylation values
of the case from the reference beta distribution.
CpGs with p-values smaller than a threshold
\code{pvalue_threshold} and with
a methylation difference with the
mean reference methylation
higher than \code{diff_threshold}
are defined as outlier CpGs. Finally,
epimutations are defined as a
group of contiguous outlier CpGs.
